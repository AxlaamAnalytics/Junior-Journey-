#In this project, I practiced common junior data analyst tasks using Excel:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Calculated average salary by department using PivotTables and AVERAGEIF.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identified the employee with the highest performance score in each department.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Filtered employees with more than 4 years at the company.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Ranked employees by salary from highest to lowest.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Added a logical check to label "Top Performer" for scores ‚â• 90.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ Created a chart to show average salary by department.  
7Ô∏è‚É£ Used COUNTIF to find how many employees have TrainingHours above 20.  
8Ô∏è‚É£ Used COUNTIFS to find how many Sales employees have Salary above 4000.

üìå Tools used: Filters, PivotTables, PivotCharts, COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, IF, RANK.

This shows my Excel skills for real workplace tasks.
